- [ ] Change base object to scene
- [ ] Assign "previous scene" value to scenes to enable going back
- [ ] Look into whether special scene types are needed
- [ ] Provide ability to add choices directly to scenes in addition to things
- [ ] Let scenes have actions
- [ ] Implement action stack
- [ ] Mock up various scenes to figure out requirements
- [ ] Map out first game - might as well use SF00
- [ ] Create built-in scenes like save, load, quit, location, combat,
   conversations that might have slightly different base behaviors ...
